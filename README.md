## ðŸ“˜ About

This project is a graphical 32-bit operating system built completely from scratch using NASM and C. It features a 16-bit bootloader, a C-based kernel, basic memory management, hardware-level keyboard/mouse input, double-buffered graphics, and cooperative multitasking. The OS runs entirely on bare-metal and is tested with QEMU.

## ðŸ› Whatâ€™s Inside

- âœ… 16-bit bootloader written in Assembly that switches to protected mode
- âœ… C-based kernel loaded and executed with memory management setup
- âœ… Direct VGA memory access to display text and graphics
- âœ… Real-time hardware I/O handling (keyboard + mouse) using interrupts
- âœ… Double-buffered graphics for smooth animation rendering
- âœ… Cooperative multitasking (bouncing ball demo, etc.)
- âœ… Fully bootable `.img` file tested via QEMU

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How x86 CPU boots and switches modes (real â†’ protected)
- How bootloaders are written in NASM and assembled into raw binaries
- How a kernel is compiled with `gcc` and linked properly with a linker script
- How interrupts and hardware I/O are handled at the OS level
- How to build multitasking systems and basic window elements from scratch

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)
- `make`

**_1. Build the OS_**

```bash
make
```

**_2. Run using QEMU_**

```bash
qemu-system-i386 -fda os.img
```

**_3. Clean Build_**

```bash
make clean
```

> Removes all object files and the generated image.

## ðŸ“¦ Final Output

- The final output is a bootable floppy image os.img that can be run in any x86 emulator like QEMU or Bochs.
